this array with correct asnwers from (a=>d) like in this example\
right answer for first question is "a"\
second question is "d"

ETC...

Second thing to do is\
modify this line where we put the student's paper picture :\

in the same folder you can put other exam paper like the pic with "part1c.jpg"

Then after you will get the answer and the result shown in the console :\
